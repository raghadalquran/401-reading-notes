# React Native
- React Native is like React, but it uses native components instead of web components as building blocks.
- You can do the component in React Native by using class or function.

## props
components can also use props.This lets you make a single component that is used in many different places in your app, with slightly different properties in each place.
 Refer to props.{NAME} in your functional components or this.props.{NAME} in your class components.
What’s the difference between state and props in React? In a React component, the props are the variables that we pass from a parent component to a child component.
 Similarly, the state is also variables, with the difference that they are not passed as parameters, but rather that the component initializes and manages them internally.
React Native combines the best parts of native development with React, a best-in-class JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
You can use React Native today in your existing Android and iOS projects or you can create a whole new app from scratch.

## Seamless Cross-Platform
React components wrap existing native code and interact with native APIs via React’s declarative UI paradigm and JavaScript. 
This enables native app development for whole new teams of developers and can let existing native teams work much faster.

## Expo
Expo apps are written in pure JS and never “drop-down” to the native iOS or Android layer.Expo allows you to eject your pure-JS project from the Expo iOS/Android clients, providing you with native projects that can be opened and built with Xcode and Android Studio. Those projects will have dependencies on ExpoKit.

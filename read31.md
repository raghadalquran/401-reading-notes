# Hooks API
- Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.
- React hooks allow to to easily create and manage state in a functional component.
- Hooks must be named with a use prefix (i.e. useFishingPole)
- Only call Hooks at the top level. Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
- Only call Hooks from React function components. Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. (There is just one other valid place to call Hooks — your own custom Hooks. We’ll learn about them in a moment.)

### How does this work?

- by convention, we use set + statevariable (camel cased) to name this function
- useState() takes a single param, which is the initial value to assign to the state variable
- You can call your setter function .. i.e. setClicks(7) and the attribute value you call the function with is used as the new value for the state variable.

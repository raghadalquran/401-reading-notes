## Redux Thunk middleware
- Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. The thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met. The inner function receives the store methods dispatch and getState as parameters.
- Thunks are the recommended middleware for basic Redux side effects logic, including complex synchronous logic that needs access to the store, and simple async logic like AJAX requests.

#### Basic Usage
The most common use-case for Redux Thunk is for communicating asynchronously with an external API to retrieve or save data. Redux Thunk makes it easy to dispatch actions that follow the lifecycle of a request to an external API.

## What is React Suspense?
Suspense is a new React feature that was announced recently at the JSConf Conference in Iceland. It aims to help with handling async operations respectively in regard to CPU power and data fetching.
